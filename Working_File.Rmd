## Setup

```{r setup}
getwd()
library(tidyverse)

survey.dat <- read.csv("./AquacultureSurveyData.csv")
survey.codes <- read.csv("./AquacultureSurveyCodes.csv")

# Set ggplot theme
mytheme <- theme_classic() +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(color = "black"), 
        legend.position = "top")
theme_set(mytheme)
```


## Basic overview questions

1. Make a dataframe just for species-related data - general analysis
      -> work w/ separate dataframes for each type of data (frequency, form, etc)?
      -> only use Tuna:Oysters since no category but frequency asks about raw forms
      -> omit Frequency_General - can analyze separately if necessary
2. Find frequency of each response
3. General overview questions:  
      *What are the most common species consumed?
      *Where do people get their seafood?  
      *How do people prefer to buy their seafood?
      *Do people prefer wild-caught or farmed seafood?
