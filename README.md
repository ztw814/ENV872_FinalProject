Data Analytics Final Project

Basic info on NC Seafood Production: https://ncseagrant.ncsu.edu/program-areas/education-training/consumer-awareness/north-carolinas-seafood-aquaculture-and-fisheries/

## Potential questions to ask
Distribution of responses to questions
  - What values do people primarily associate with aquaculture?
  - How do people currently get their seafood?

Regression analyses:
  - How does age relate to attitudes towards aquaculture?
  - Do gender, political party, education level affect attitudes?
  - Do responses to preference differ between species and if so, how?
