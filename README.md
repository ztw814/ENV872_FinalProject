Rate: Please answer to the best of your ability, and rate the following statements based on how much they represent the way you think. 
    - Shellfish mariculture is really a win-win-win. It’s good for the environment, you’re able to produce stuff that’s good to eat, and it creates good revenue for a grower.
    - There’s a lot of people in the mainland that aren’t eating oysters yet that don’t even know they’re going to love oysters. There’s markets that need to be opened up still. The future is really bright, there’s a lot of potential.
    - Regulations on fishing are definitely needed, but in the right balance, in the right context.
    - The fishermen don’t get nearly as much money for their product as they should, because of the way the market’s set up. It’s due to imports and the local dealers not really seeking better markets for the product.
    - Big companies have the same right as local families and farmers to get mariculture leases in state waters.
    - Losing commercial fishing means losing a heritage and tradition that is passed down from generation to generation, grandfathers and fathers and uncles and cousins.
    - Growing seafood production is important not just locally, but because we have more and more people that need healthy food and the U.S. can’t just keep importing everything we eat.
    - Oyster farms are like wild oyster reefs because juvenile fish and crustaceans and everything hang around there. So that actually makes fishing around a farm even better.
    - The next generation of fishing is aquaculture.
    - You should be a resident to get a mariculture lease. People from out of state shouldn’t have the same access to our waters.
    - There’s no doubt in my mind you can overfish fisheries. Left to their own devices, it’s hard for fishermen to cut back.
    - That’s what the fish are there for. To be harvested for us, you know. That’s what God put them in the water for.
    
Rank (NC fishing): Please rank the following perspectives based on how much they represent the way you think. Drag and drop the statements to rank them, with 1 (top) being most like how you think and 4 (bottom) being least like how you think.
    - Growing the North Carolina seafood industry is critical to sustaining our coastal communities and economies, whether it is through traditional commercial fishing, a new focus on growing the shellfish aquaculture sector, or a combination of both.
    - When it comes to North Carolina seafood, expanding shellfish aquaculture should take priority over commercial fishing because it is more scientifically sound  and provides environmental benefits to our coastal waters.
    - The North Carolina commercial fishing industry is negatively impacted by a number of forces, including unfair seafood import prices and competition from shellfish aquaculture, so it is important that we find ways to allow commercial fishermen to continue their livelihoods and grow their industry  with fewer impediments from regulation and competition.
    - Commercial fishing is the backbone of North Carolina’s coastal communities and seafood industry, and even though locally-run shellfish aquaculture might fit into the coastal picture, it will never replace commercial fishermen and what they provide to their communities.
